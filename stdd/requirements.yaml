    why: "A calendar view provides users with a visual timeline of their job search activity for pattern identification and follow-up planning"
    problems_solved:
      - "No visual timeline of activity"
      - "Difficulty seeing temporal patterns"
      - "Hard to plan follow-ups"
    benefits:
      - "Visual timeline of activity"
      - "Pattern identification"
      - "Month-at-a-glance view"
      - "Complements table view"
  satisfaction_criteria:
    - criterion: "Page accessible at /jobs/calendar route"
    - criterion: "Calendar displays one month at a time in 7-column grid"
    - criterion: "Positions appear on posting date, applications on application date"
    - criterion: "Month navigation controls work (Previous, Next, Today)"
    - criterion: "Clicking items displays details in panel above grid"
    - criterion: "All UI elements are config-driven"
  validation_criteria:
    - method: "Page testing"
      coverage: "Page renders without errors at /jobs/calendar"
    - method: "Calendar testing"
      coverage: "Items appear on correct dates, navigation updates month"
    - method: "Config testing"
      coverage: "All text comes from config (no hard-coded labels)"

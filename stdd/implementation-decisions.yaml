# Implementation Decisions Index (YAML Database)
#
# This YAML file serves as the central index/registry for all implementation decisions in the project.
# Each top-level key is a semantic token (e.g., IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION).
#
# To append a new implementation decision:
# 1. Copy the template block at the bottom of this file (IMPL-IDENTIFIER)
# 2. Paste it at the end with a blank line before it
# 3. Replace IMPL-IDENTIFIER with your new token
# 4. Fill in all fields
# 5. Update the detail_file path to match your new .md file in implementation-decisions/ directory
#
# Field descriptions:
#   name: Short descriptive name of the decision
#   status: Active | Deprecated | Template | Superseded
#   cross_references: List of ARCH-* and REQ-* tokens this decision implements
#   rationale: Structured explanation with why, problems_solved, benefits
#   implementation_approach: Structured approach with summary and details
#   code_locations: Structured code locations with files and functions
#   traceability: Structured links to architecture, requirements, tests, code_annotations
#   related_decisions: Lists of depends_on, supersedes, see_also (YAML lists or [])
#   detail_file: Path to the detailed .md file in implementation-decisions/ directory
#   metadata: Structured metadata with created, last_updated, last_validated info
